# Instructions
Run the archinstall script and select your preferred settings. When you get in, you need to create a folder called "documents", and inside it a folder called "repos". At this point you just need to git clone "https://github.com/chrisbrinchlarsen/zuparch.git" while inside the repos folder. CD into the repos folder and run ./zuparch.sh

# Post Installation
Once the install script is done, you need to manually edit the .xinitrc file to launch whatever programs you want on launch, as well as start your preferred desktop environment. (DWM is already configured)
